# A Data Analyst's Journey 

## Welcome to The Data Narrative

Hi, I’m **Aeden Manell** – a data analyst who believes the best insights aren’t found in textbooks, they’re earned in the late-night debugging sessions, the stakeholder meetings that go sideways, and the moments when a single well-written query finally makes the data sing.

This blog is my public notebook. Here I document:

- The SQL queries that turned weeks of manual work into minutes  
- The Python scripts (and sometimes R) that automated the impossible  
- The dashboards that actually got used (and the ones that didn’t)  
- The hard-won lessons from real-world projects in startups, enterprises, and everything in between  
- Mistakes I’ve made so you (hopefully) don’t have to  

If you’ve ever:
- Spent three days hunting down a mismatch because of a hidden space character  
- Had to explain to a non-technical stakeholder why “average” can lie  
- Felt the pure joy of watching a 6-hour report finish in 42 seconds  

…you’re in the right place.

### What you’ll find here

- **Deep-dive case studies** from actual projects (anonymized, of course)  
- **Practical code snippets** you can steal and adapt today  
- **Tool reviews** that cut through the hype  
- **Career notes** from someone who’s been an analyst, a senior analyst, a consultant, and occasionally the “Excel wizard”  
- **Occasional rants** about bad charts and worse data practices (you’ve been warned)
